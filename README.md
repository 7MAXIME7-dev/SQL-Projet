# SQL-Projet


Hello everyone,

Here is a Project about Covid 19. The aim was to use a DataSet in order to reveal the potential of data and draw conclusions.

If you want to use this code in MySql, open the sql file, create a schema named covid_19 and add the csv table 
as patient.


## My conclusions about this DataSet : 

To conclude there are a lot of true facts resulting of this Dataset. 
This dataset is not perfect and old (published 2 month ago), that's why we can't draw precise result but we have the general trend.
So, in this conclusion I will try to resume the main points with certainties.

1) Principle factors of pandemic trigger are : contact with patient, visit to Italy,
   and Mulhouse gethering.

2) The most affected region of France are: Grand-Est & Ile-De-France.

3) The percentage of deceased cases for people aged of 60 Years old or more is higher
   than normal.

4) The percentage of deceased cases for people aged of 80 Years old is very high.
   So, deceased risk increase with age.

5) There is 50 % old (> 60 y) and 50 % young (< 60 y) in hospital. 

6) People are mostly with good status in hospital.
